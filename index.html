            <img src="assets/images/biopic.jpg" class="profilepic" alt="profile pic">
            <p>I was born in Corpus Christi, TX, but quickly became an Austinite, so I consider myself native to Austin. I recently
                spent about 5 years in Los Angeles, but couldn't help coming back home. I love art, music, and design. Animals
                are also a big passion of mine. Right now, I've got four dogs, three cats, and a baby in my household.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Westlake High School and then attended Texas State University, where I got my BA in Mass Communications.
                I minored in Business and also became certified to teach at the elementary level, special education, and
                ESL. I look forward to creating an exemplary portfolio.</p>
